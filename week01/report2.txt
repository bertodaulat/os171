* Pushing, pulling and editing text inside Git *
1. Open cd <filename> and then type vi <file name for text editor> to create a .txt file.
2. Press "i" on your computer/laptop to make sure that the bottom most of your Terminal/PuTTY has declared "--INSERT--" to make sure that you are writing insidethe .txt file
3. After finishing your text editing, press "Esc" on your computer/laptop to quit from INSERT mode, to compiling/saving mode. Type :wq to save your file entirely.
4. Do the GitPush and GitPull to make sure that your file is pushed into your GitHub repository, using the file given in Scele. 
5. Then you're done :)
